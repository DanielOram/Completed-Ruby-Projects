Showcase of completed Ruby Projects I have made :)

Below is a list with descriptions of each project files(s):


# stopwatch.rb - this file contains a class called Stopwatch which allows the user to pass a code block of any sort of process in order to get a run-time in seconds. Good example of a multi-threaded application.

# fibonacci.rb - When run, this file takes an integer as input from the command line and outputs that index of the fibonacci series using simple recursion. Purpose of this was to show how slow an un-optimised algorithm can be. try stay to 10 or lower for running time purposes...

# dynamicFibonacci.rb - When run, this file takes an integer as input from the command line and outputs that index of the fibonacci series using dynamic programming! this is an optimised version of fibonacci.rb that I made that makes use of dictionaries in ruby in order to eliminate recursive function calls that have already been previously calculated. A CRAP TONNE FASTER! can go to a 1000 easily.
